This branch is in a "being rewritten" state.

## Setup
Some platform-specific dependencies must be installed first:
### Ubuntu (20.04)
`sudo apt install gcc g++ libcurl4-dev libgeos-dev proj-bin`
### MacOS
`brew install proj`

Following this, you should be able to install the requirements with

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Contributing

Please ensure that all configured github actions workflows for code formatting,
linting and tests are green before merging changes.

## Authors

Because of the refactor, this branch wiped out a lot of author information.

This code was primarily written by @tylerni7 and @MGNute

Further contribution from @tinfoil-globe, @Tobychev, and @jmccartin
